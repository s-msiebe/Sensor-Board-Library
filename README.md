# Sensor-Board-Library
  
The library enables communication between the sensor, gateway and bridge.
The library covers the steps of configuring the sensor board through the gateway and then communicating between the sensor board and bridge.
Since the library is kept very abstract, various boards, sensors and devices can be used.

# Dependencies
The LinkedIoT-library is dependent on the following libraries. Please add them to your build path in order to use them.

- **SmallHttp**
https://github.com/bergos/SmallHttp
This library provides a http-server, which is used to build a connection to the gateway.
- **ArduinoJson**
https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
This library provides a JSON-library, which is very efficient and designed for IoT-devices.

- **Arduino**
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino
This library provides the Arduino functionality.
